# Impact-of-AI---Analysis-using-Power-BI

## 1. Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the global impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on various sectors and economies. Leveraging a public dataset, the project explores key trends in AI adoption, its effect on revenue and employment, and the influence of regulatory environments on consumer trust.

## 2. Dataset
The core of this project is a detailed dataset on global AI content impact.

**Dataset Name:** Impact of AI on Digital Media 2020-2025

**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/impact-of-ai-on-digital-media-2020-2025

The dataset contains a variety of metrics including `Country`, `Year`, `Industry`, `AI Adoption Rate (%)`, `AI-Generated Content Volume (TBs per year)`, `Job Loss Due to AI (%)`, `Revenue Increase Due to AI (%)`, `Regulation Status`, and `Consumer Trust in AI (%)`.

## 3. Project Methodology
This project follows a complete data analysis lifecycle, from data acquisition and storage to visualization and insight generation.

**Data Acquisition:** The dataset was programmatically downloaded from Kaggle using Python. This ensures a reproducible and efficient data retrieval process.

**Data Storage:** The cleaned dataset was then exported and stored in a MySQL relational database. This step demonstrates proficiency in database management and prepares the data for integration with various Business Intelligence tools.

**Data Visualization & Analysis:** The data was imported from the MySQL database into Power BI. A series of interactive reports and dashboards were created to visualize the key trends and insights from the data.

## 4. Report Pages & Key Insights
The Power BI reports are divided into three main pages, each focusing on a different aspect of AI's impact.

### Page 1: Industry Specific Analysis
This page focuses on the differentiated impact of AI across various industries, highlighting which sectors are leading in revenue growth, content volume, and adoption rates.

**Key Visualizations:**

- A card highlights the `Average AI adoption Rate`: **54.57** from 2020 to 2025.

- A card highlights the `Average Market share of AI`: **26.57**.

- A card highlights the `Average of Human-AI collaboration Rate`: **25.79**.

- A card highlights the `Average Revenue increase due to AI`: **39.72**.  
  
- A column chart titled `Average AI adoption Rate(%) by Year` shows more in the year 2023 as **60%**.

- A bar chart displays the `Average Human-AI collaboration Rate(%) by Country` shows Australia has the most of **59%**.

**Key Insight:** The analysis shows that 2023 has the most AI adoption rate in th eperiod of 2020 to 2025 and Australia has the most Human-AI collaboration Rate.
